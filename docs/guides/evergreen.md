# Account creation & App tokens

You can query SODA datasets without identifying yourself (at least in version 2.1) but limits will apply.

For version 3.0 it is supposed to be required to identify requests with a token.

In these cases you may want to [create an account](https://evergreen.data.socrata.com/signup){target="\_blank"} with the `Evergreen Data Library`.

From there you can [create an App token](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/210138558-Generating-App-Tokens-and-API-Keys){target="\_blank"} to include in your requests for identification.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! tip "Recommended"
    Overall it is recommended to identify your requests using a token.
